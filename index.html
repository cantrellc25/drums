								<h2>Tama<br />
								elementum magna</h2>
								<p>With over 40 years of experience, Tama knows what drummers really want. Which is why, no matter how long you've been playing the drums, no matter what budget you have to work with, Tama has the set you need, want, and can afford. Every aspect of the modern drum kit was exhaustively examined and reexamined and then improved before it was accepted as part of the Imperialstar design. Which is why, if you start playing Imperialstar now as a beginner, you'll still enjoy playing it when you've achieved pro-status. That's how good these groundbreaking new drums are. Only Tama Imperialstar comes with a complete set of genuine Meinl HCS cymbals. These high-quality brass cymbals are made in Germany and are sonically matched so they sound great together. They are even lathed for a more refined tonal character. The set includes 14" hi-hats, 16" crash and an 20" ride cymbal.
